MXCuBE stands for Macromolecular Xtallography Customized Beamline Environment.
The project started in 2005 at [ESRF](http://www.esrf.eu), since then it has
been adopted by other institutes in Europe. In 2010, a collaboration
agreement has been signed for the development of MXCuBE with the following
partners:

- ESRF
- [Soleil](http://www.synchrotron-soleil.fr/)
- [Max IV](https://www.maxiv.lu.se/)
- [HZB](http://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/)
- [EMBL](http://www.embl.org/)
- [Global Phasing Ltd.](http://www.globalphasing.com/)
- [ALBA](https://www.cells.es/en/)
- [DESY](https://www.desy.de/)
- [LNLS](https://www.lnls.cnpem.br/)
- [Elettra] (https://www.elettra.trieste.it/)
- [NSRRC] (https://www.nsrrc.org.tw/english/index.aspx)
