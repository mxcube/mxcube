# **MXCuBE** - Macromolecular Xtallography Customized Beamline Environment

The MXCuBE project started in 2005 at [ESRF](http://www.esrf.eu),
with the objective of providing crystallography beamlines users
an easy-to-use software platform to run their experiments.
In 2010, a collaboration agreement has been signed for the
development of MXCuBE between the major synchrotron facilities in
Europe. 

Today MXCuBE is actively supported by the following partners: ESRF,
[Soleil](http://www.synchrotron-soleil.fr),
[MAX IV](http://www.maxlab.lu.se/),
[HZB](https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/),
[EMBL](http://www.embl.org),
[Global Phasing Ltd](http://www.globalphasing.com),
[DESY](http://www.desy.de),
[ALBA](http://www.cells.es).

There are two front-end implementations built on top of the same
high-level beamline control layer called [mxcubecore](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcubecore)
